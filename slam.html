  <h1><strong>About</strong></h1>
  
  <p>I go by <em><strong>Jedi</strong></em> and I'm a programmer from Wellington, New Zealand <!-- &#128187 -->&#127475; &#127487;</p>
  <p>I'll probably playing video games, watching movies or reading books if I'm not coding.</p>
  <p>My favorite programming language is Python and currently learning and possible transition to Java.</p> 

  <h2><strong>Here is a definition of my favourite animal on the planet:</strong></h2> 
  
  <!-- Will definitely edit later, just a sample to occupy space -->

  <p>
    "The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 
    It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
    It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
    A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
    The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.
